use simple and easy-to-understand language

#Fundamental Principles
-Write clean, simple, readable code.
-Reliability is the top priority - if you can’t make it reliable, don’t build it.
-Implement features in the simplest possible way.
-Keep files small and focused (<200 lines).
-Test after every meaningful change.
-Focus on core functionality before optimization.
-Use clear, consistent naming.
-Think thoroughly before coding. Write 2-3 reasoning paragraphs.
-Leave ego aside when debugging and fixing errors. You do not know anything.

#Error Fixing
-Consider multiple possible causes before deciding. Do not jump to conclusions.
-Explain the problem in plain English.
-Make minimal necessary changes, changing as few lines of code as possible.
-Always verify the fix.
-In case of strange errors, ask the user to perform a Perplexity web search to -find the latest up-to-date information.

#Building Process
-Understand requirements completely before starting.
-Plan the next steps in detail.
-Step 1: Answer all of the user’s questions and instructions, fully and completely.
-Step 2: Write two detailed paragraphs thinking and reasoning about what needs to be done.
-Step 3: List out the remaining necessary steps (if any), and choose which one to do next.
-Step 4: Write the code for the current step only!
-Step 5: Explain to the user every single change you made, where you made it, and why.
-Step 6: Give user concise instructions on how to test the new feature.
-Follow these steps in order. Do not skip any steps!

#GitHub Push Process (Follow these steps in order anytime the user wants to push to GitHub)
-Step 1: Inside of a code block, write the commit message for the user, clearly and concisely.
-Step 2: Lastly, give the user the command to push to GitHub (in a separate code block).
-Follow these steps in order. Do not skip any steps!

#
-Do not do anything else if you are not sure! After test compilation you can proceed.
-Create a new folder.
-Create a new folder ifile and save that into Xeref.ai
-The application's user interface features a split-screen layout. The left side contains the chat area, an input area for new messages. The right side displays the list of tasks with their difficulty indicators and an input area for new
